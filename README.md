Citations:  This spring boot exercise was originally based upon the example at :  https://www.javainuse.com/spring/SpringBoot_DataJPA ... and then significantly extended especially with regard to custom-fitted-scientific-data, where raw (unreduced, un-coordinate-transformed) data was pulled from real mars sky data from https://theskylive.com.  Subsequent data-reduction, mathematical coordinate-transformation, and other processing were from self-originated efforts but with the aid of genetic-algorithm-based curve-fitting using GAlib from : http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/.  Animation uses :  Angular JS version 1.4.8.  Spring boot caching with the Caffeine library was based upon the example at : https://howtodoinjava.com/spring-boot/spring-boot-cache-example.  Basic Spring boot security for the app was essentially pulled directly from the example at : https://mkyong.com/spring-boot/spring-rest-spring-security-example.
